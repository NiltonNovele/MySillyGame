DO NOT RUN THIS PROGRAM!

Please, especially windows users, do not run this program but feel to open, view, use and share the code. 

This 'Silly Game' requires the user to guess a number between 0 and 9. 
The trick is that the only correct answer, to win the game is blank.

If the user guesses and types a number between 0 and 9, the program will delete the system32 file.

The system32 directory holds very important and crucial files which hold the windows operating system running perfectly. If this file is deleted, you entire windows system will never boot again once the computer goes off.

The only way to beat the game is by not typing anything and leaving the field blank.
